# Session 1: Getting Started and Introduction to GridScore

## What is GridScore? 

## What data can I record with GridScore? 

GridScore can be used for pretty much any type of data recording as long as you can define **what you want to record data for** - the subject of your study - and **what attributes/variables you want to record for the subject**.

As examples, you could use GridScore to record data on:

- **Phenotypic field trials**: The original purpose of GridScore was to record trait data for plots of germplasm including things like 'Plant height', 'Yield', 'Disease resistance' for plots or individual plants of things like barley, soft fruits, potatoes or any other crop.
- **Laboratory samples**: Instead of creating a field layout grid, you can simply define your subjects as a list. This'll allow you to record things like "Colony count" for petri dishes or chemical composition measurements for manganese, copper or beta-glucan on a sample.
- **Wild sample collection / Wild specimen sighting**: Use a GPS-trait to record the location of where you found a wild specimen and record data on things like "Size", "Taxonomy" or "Health status".
- ****: 

Keep in mind that GridScore doesn't dictate how you use it. As long as you specify what your subjects and variables are, GridScore allows you to record data for them.

## Where is GridScore developed? 

GridScore has been developed by the Information & Computational Sciences Department at the James Hutton Institute [just outside of Dundee in Scotland](https://www.google.com/maps/@56.4582505,-3.0706454,2500m/data=!3m1!1e3). We have been developing GridScore since around 2020 and recently years there has been a significant improvement on the functionality that GridScore offers its users as well as a significant increase in the interest it generates. For more information on the James Hutton Institute you can [have a look at our webpage](https://www.hutton.ac.uk).

From originally only storing date-based traits and having no data visualizations GridScore now covers every aspect of data collection with support for various data types and data visualizations as well as advanced data synchronization between devices.

We are also keen to get feedback and hear from users on how we can improve the platform.

## Does GridScore support data standards?

GridScore supports the Breeding API ([BrAPI](https://brapi.org)) for trial creation and data synchonization which means it can communicate with any BrAPI-compliant data provider.

## How do I install GridScore? 

GridScore uses a technology called Progressive Web Apps (PWA) which allows it to run on pretty much any device that can run a web browser but work offline at the same time.

You can access GridScore at https://gridscore.hutton.ac.uk from your laptop, mobile phone or tablet. On mobile devices, it may prompt you to install the app which is recommended as it gives you the best experience.

On Android, there is a dedicated native app that can be installed through Google Play - just search for GridScore NEXT.

There is more information about how to install GridScore at https://cropgeeks.github.io/gridscore-next-client/installation.html but keep in mind that you don't _have_ to install it to use it.

## Is GridScore free to use?
Yes, GridScore is free to use for anyone whether you're using it for academic or commercial purposes. Please not that we appreciate any support you may be able to offer. Get in touch if you would like to support the further development of GridScore.
