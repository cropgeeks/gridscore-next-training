# GridScore training material

Last Updated: 19th November 2024

The following material has been developed to allow you to get some experience in using GridScore. It can be taken at your own pace and each section forms a self contained set of learning materials. If you follow the order of the training material each will build on what you have learned in the previous.

We will update this list with new training materials and resources as we develop them. Just get in touch with us [sebastian.raubach@hutton.ac.uk](mailto:sebastian.raubach@hutton.ac.uk) if you have any questions or any suggestions on how we can improve this resource. Our intention is to keep this under continual review so there will be updated materials from time to time so keep an eye on this page for updates.
