# Before we start...

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to look at our GridScore training. Its a work in progress but we hope to develop it into a helpful resource on using the platform.

We have tried to create a series of GridScore training sessions that can be used to get a handle on how to use GridScore and get hands on training on using the tools and features that GridScore offers. We will use demo datasets/trials that have been set up for this training and it is incredibly important to stress that where we are adding or editing data that **you cannot break anything** - just go for it, try things, and see how GridScore works!

>The GridScore datasets/trials that we will use can be accessed from [https://gridscore.hutton.ac.uk/#/load-example](https://gridscore.hutton.ac.uk/#/load-example).

We have broken down each training session into distinct sections. Most will start with a description of what the session will contain, some will have YouTube videos that explain and demonstrate the concepts we want to convey, some will have have additional information then a series of tasks and answers that will let you get experience in using GridScore using real data.

> In sections where there may be example files that are used we will provide links to these so you can download to your computer.

This training has been designed for you to carry out at your own pace. Each section is self contained and while we recommend that you carry each out in series, you can do this training at your own pace and come back to sections if you are unsure or just want to try the user excersises again at the end of each section.

We absolutely understand that learning new software can be difficult and so if you have any problems whatsoever then please just ask. You can contact us on [sebastian.raubach@hutton.ac.uk](mailto:sebastian.raubach@hutton.ac.uk) and we will do what we can.

### Important GridScore Links
We won't be able to cover everything here and we do have other information available on GridScore. Other resources include [our GitHub page](https://cropgeeks.github.io/get-gridscore) which will give you an overview of the project. You can also browse the GridScore source code on GitHub. All GridScore code is open-source and we always welcome contributions or logging bugs and feature requests [which can be done from the Github page](https://github.com/cropgeeks/gridscore-next-client).

There is a GridScore publications that is well worth reading and will give you a bit of background to the project.
